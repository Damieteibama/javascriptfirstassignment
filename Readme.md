Question 1 - Node.js can be used to run JavsaScript console on any command-line interface or terminal
Question 2 - i) JavaScript is used to develop Web and mobile applications
             ii) It adds interactive behavior to web pages
             iii) it is used to build Web servers and developing server applications
             iv) Game development
             v) Desktop applications
Question 3 - European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)Script for Standardization was first released June 1997
Question 4 - Open up the broswer on your computer, Right Click on an empty area and go to inspect This opens up developer tools. Here, select the console tab. This is the Javascript console and you can write any valid javascript here. Type console.log('Hello World'); press enter when done, You would see the Hello World message on the console.
Question 5 - i)FrontEnd Development
            ii)Backend Development
            iii)Mobile Development
            iv)Artificial Inteligence 
Question 6 - i) Statically typed programming language is one in which the type of a variable is known at compile time.This simply means the programmer must specify what type each variable is. while Dynamically typed programming language perform type checking at runtime. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages (like Groovy) can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly (if at all it will run). 
              ii)Second, statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not while Dynamically-typed languages are more flexible and can save you time and space when writing scripts
              iii) Types of Statically typed programming laugage includes: Java, C , C++
                   Types of Dynamically typed languages includes: JavaScript , Python, Ruby, PHP
Question 7 - i) Null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable which indicates that a variable does not point any object while Undefined data type is not an assignment value. It means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
             ii) Null It is an object while Undefined is a type itself
             iii) Null value is a primitive value which represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference while Undefined value is a primitive value, which is used when a variable has not been assigned a value.
             iv)Null indicates the absence of a value for a variable while Undefined indicates the absence of the variable itself.
